% "Overdrive" simulation with symmetrical soft clipping.
%
%
% DESCRIPTION:
% Up to the threshold of th the input is multiplied by two and the
% characteristic curve is in the linear region. Between input values of th
% up to 1-th, the characteristic curve produces a soft compression. Above
% the input value of 1-th the output value is set to 1.
%
% INPUT PARAMETERS:
%   x: excitation signal - clear far end signal
%   th: nonlinearity threshold
%
% OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
%   y: output distorted signal
